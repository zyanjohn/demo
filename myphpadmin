Sure, here are the steps to install and configure phpMyAdmin on Linux Mint:
1.Update the package manager:
        sudo apt-get update
2.Install Apache web server, MySQL database server, and PHP:
    sudo apt-get install apache2 mysql-server php php-mysql
3.Install phpMyAdmin:
    sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin
4.During the installation, you will be asked to choose the web server that you want to use to configure phpMyAdmin. Choose apache2 using the spacebar, and then press Enter to continue.
5.You will also be asked to configure a database for phpMyAdmin. Choose yes, and then enter the MySQL root password that you set during the installation of MySQL.
6.After the installation is complete, open the configuration file for Apache web server:
    sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
7.Add the following line at the end of the file:
    Include /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf
8.Save and close the file by pressing Ctrl+X, Y, and then Enter.

9.Restart the Apache web server:
    sudo service apache2 restart
10.Open your web browser and go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin. You should see the phpMyAdmin login screen.

11.Log in with your MySQL username and password.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The username and password you need to log in to phpMyAdmin is the MySQL database username and password that you created during the installation of MySQL.

If you didn't create a MySQL user during the installation, you can log in with the root user and its password. However, it's not recommended to use the root user for regular database operations for security reasons.

To create a new MySQL user, you can follow these steps:

1.Log in to MySQL as the root user:
    sudo mysql -u root -p
2.Create a new user by running the following command (replace newusername and password with your desired username and password):
    CREATE USER 'newusername'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
3.Grant the new user permission to access the databases by running the following command:
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'newusername'@'localhost';
4.Flush the privileges:
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
After creating the new user, you can use its username and password to log in to phpMyAdmin.
